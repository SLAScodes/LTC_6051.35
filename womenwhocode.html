	  <p>This was a great experience for me to interact with other woman like me who code. My 10week course of Learn To Code at Sanleandro Adult School  have been challenging in a good way teaching me how to code at the beginner stage and showing me the tools I will need to become a coder; my teacher Lisa Rose have taught me all the source codes, language and tools I will need to become a real coder,Thank You. My journey of coding seems so bright for the future and I am ready to learn so much more and network with other coders in the work field of coding. </p>
