<h1>Heading</h1>
<!-- a comment saying what the heading is -->


<p>paragraph</p>
<!-- text between the ps gets printed -->

<p>I am happy that something that is happening
on the screen.

Previously nothing appeared.

But I am not sure what it was that changed.
</p>

<p> what are the other things </p><p> that can be programmed?
</p>

<!-- Below will add a link to a newspaper  -->

<p> We can hyperlink </p>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com"> Read the newspaper </a>


<p>We can write <b>BOLD</b> or <i>italic</i>
</p>

<p>we can include a picture</p>


<embed src="C:\Users\Student\Desktop\Essential Computing\ecs2_SEF\ecs2-L07\Mesa Verde Cliff Palace Ruins.jpg">

<p>Maybe we can do something else</p>
<p>Let's try to do the javascript thing.</p>
<p>I've never done javascript at all, but there is a tutorial</p>
<p>Let's try the tutorial</p>

<!--define a button on the screen -->
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Clickable </button>

<!-- button is defined above.  But the line above doesn't define what (myFunction) does -->

<!-- Below define a variable and what the button does with a script (myFunction) -->

<p id="variable_which_is_text">Before the click </p>
<script>
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("variable_which_is_text").innerHTML =
"After the click";
}
</script>

<!-- part of that seemed crazy -->
<!-- like what is innerHTML??? -->


<p>Clicking the button above will change the text above </p>
