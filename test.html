<p> My first entry on our new blog is being posted a few hours after the sun started heading south for the year. We celebrated this longest day of the year with some wine at lunch and discussions about how we will layout the vegetable beds for the best exposure to the sun.  Also, we learned the longest path of the sun across our future yard farm,  One of our main objectives will be to utilize the sunlight for the maximum benefit to everyone including our part of the soil food web. 

We conducted an experiment with some of our soil. This farm began in April 2015 in a San Leandro, CA backyard. The lot is almost 1/4 of an acre.</p>

<p> It was started by a Type 1 Diabetic and a Type 2 Diabetic.</p>

<p>First the soil was tested.</p>
